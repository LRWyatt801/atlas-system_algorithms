# Huffman Coding

Huffman coding is an algorithm used in loseless compression.  It consists of finding the frequency of characters in a file, building a binary heap, and finally building a huffman tree.  Which is then used to asign characters a smaller bit combination based on position in the huffman tree.

The tasks I was required to do were:
- Create a Min Binary Heap
- Create Node in Min Binary Heap
- Insert Node in Min Binary Heap
- Extract Node from Min Binary Heap
- Delete Min Binary Heap
- Create a Symbol - stuct to hold frequency and character
- Build a Priority Queue
- Extract from Priority Queue
- Build the Huffman Tree
- Assign the Huffman Codes

## Learning Objectives

- What is a binary heap (min and max)
- What is a priority queue
- What is Huffman Code

### Provided code and Headers

Within ```huffman.h``` and ```heap/heap.h``` will be provided structs.  I will also be adding any prototypes and any other data types I need.

### Example Main Functions

In the folder ```main_files``` will be the provided main files to test each given task.  Each main file will include the ```main()``` and the expected output.
