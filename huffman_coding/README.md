# Huffman Coding

In this directory I will be learning about Huffman coding and binary heaps.  Within the folder heap I will be implementing a binary heap and learning about what they are.

## Learning Objectives

- What is a binary heap (min and max)
- What is a priority queue
- What is Huffman Code

### Provided code and Headers

Within ```huffman.h``` and ```heap/heap.h``` will be provided structs.  I will also be adding any prototypes and any other data types I need.

### Example Main Functions

In the folder ```main_files``` will be the provided main files to test each given task.  Each main file will include the ```main()``` and the expected output.
