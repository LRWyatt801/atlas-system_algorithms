# System Algorithms

A collection of system-level data structures and algorithms implemented in C.<br>
This repository demonstrates my understanding and implementation of advanced programming topics, organized into the following directories:
- [graphs/](./graphs)
- [huffman_coding/](./huffman_coding)
- [n_ary_trees/](./n_ary_trees)
- [pathfinding/](./pathfinding)
- [red_black_tree/](./red_black_tree)

## Graphs

A graph is a data structure containing a finite set of nodes in which they can have connections/edges to other nodes.  Creating a web like network between every node.  They are used to represent and analyze relationships between objects or entities.

For this project the required tasks I was to implement were:
- Create Graph
- Add a Vertex
- Add an Edge
- Delete a Graph
- Depth-first Traversal
- Breadth-first Traversal

By completeing these tasks I gained a solid understanding of what a graph is and the neccessary algorithms to do so.
