# System Algorithms

A collection of system-level data structures and algorithms implemented in C.<br>
This repository demonstrates my understanding and implementation of advanced programming topics, organized into the following directories/projects:
- [graphs/](./graphs)
- [huffman_coding/](./huffman_coding)
- [n_ary_trees/](./n_ary_trees)
- [pathfinding/](./pathfinding)
- [red_black_tree/](./red_black_tree)

Each directory will have a more in depth README due to each one being its own project.
