# System Algorithms

A collection of system-level data structures and algorithms implemented in C.<br>
This repository demonstrates my understanding and implementation of advanced programming topics, organized into the following directories/projects:
- [graphs/](./graphs)
- [huffman_coding/](./huffman_coding)
- [n_ary_trees/](./n_ary_trees)
- [pathfinding/](./pathfinding)
- [red_black_tree/](./red_black_tree)

Each project includes a dedicated README with detailed explanations, design decisions, and usage instructions.

Hey there! I’m Logan Wyatt — a former Operational Specialist with over 5 years of real-world problem-solving and customer service experience, now transitioning into the world of software engineering.

I specialize in low-level Linux development, system programming in C, and advanced algorithm design. My unique background helps me bridge the gap between technical complexity and real user needs.

This repository is a product of my hands-on learning and deep dive into system-level programming. Here, I’ve implemented core concepts like red-black trees, Huffman coding, graph traversal, and custom pathfinding algorithms — all built from scratch to reinforce my understanding of how these systems operate at a low level.

Beyond this project, I’ve also explored:

- Linux internals and process management in my custom [Linux system repo](https://github.com/LRWyatt801/atlas-system_linux)

- A retro-style custom game called [MEGAdrive](https://github.com/DaveyCHaysIII/Megadrive), built with a focus on game logic and learning different aspects of C++

- And several other explorations in C, algorithms, and system design on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/LRWyatt801)

I build these tools from the ground up not only to understand how things work under the hood — but because I genuinely love the challenge of bringing complex systems to life through code.

I'm driven by curiosity, fueled by Dr. Pepper, and excited to continue growing as a developer. If you're into clean, efficient, and purposeful code — let’s connect or collaborate!
