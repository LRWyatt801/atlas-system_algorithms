# Pathfinding

Within this directory I will be learning about pathfinding.  There will be two different algorithms used, backtracking and Dijkstra.

## Project tasks

- ```backtracking_array``` - finds the first path from start to target in an array
- ```backtracking_graph``` - finds the first path from start to target in a graph
- ```dijkstra_graph``` - finds the shortest path from start to target in a graph using Dijkstra's algorithm
  - ```dijkstra_graph_1``` - is just another example of ```dijkstra_graph```

## Learning Objectives

- What is pathfinding
- What are the most common applications of pathfinding
- What is backtracking, and why you should never use it
- What is Dijkstra’s algorithm, and what is its main weakness
- What is A star algorithm, and how it is better than Dijkstra’s

## /main_files

This folder will contain the given example code that will be used to test written code.

With in path_libraries are the provided libraries used for queues and graphs.
