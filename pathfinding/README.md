# Pathfinding

Within this directory I will be learning about pathfinding.  There will be two different algorithms used, backtracking and Dijkstra.

## Learning Objectives

- What is pathfinding
- What are the most common applications of pathfinding
- What is backtracking, and why you should never use it
- What is Dijkstra’s algorithm, and what is its main weakness
- What is A star algorithm, and how it is better than Dijkstra’s

### Main_files

This folder will contain the given example code that will can be used to test written code.
With in path_libraries are the provided libraries used for queues and graphs.
