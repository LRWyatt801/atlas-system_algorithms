# N-ary Trees

A n-ary tree is sort of like a graph in which each node can have no more than _m_ children.
For example a binary tree is a case where m=2.

## Project Tasks

- ```0-nary_tree_insert``` - inserts a node into a N-ary tree
- ```1-nary_tree_delete``` - deallocates a n-ary tree
- ```2-nary_tree_traverse``` - traverse a n-ary tree
- ```3-nary_tree_diameter``` - finds the diameter of a n-ary tree
- ```4-path_exists``` - find a path in an n-ary tree

## Learning Objectives

- What is a N-ary tree
- What are the most common usage of N-ary trees
- How to represent an N-ary tree in C in at least two different ways
- What is the diameter of an N-ary tree

## Main Files

The ```/main_files``` will be examples of how each function will be used and executed.
They will also be used in testing.
