# Graphs

A graph is a data structure containing a finite set of nodes in which they can have connections/edges to other nodes.  Creating a web like network between every node.  They are used to represent and analyze relationships between objects or entities.

For this project the required tasks I was to implement were:
- ```graph_create``` - creates a graph data structure in memory
- ```graph_add_vertex``` - adds a vertex or node to a graph
- ```graph_add_edge``` - adds an edge to a vertex/node in a graph
- ```graph_delete``` - deallocates and entire graph
- ```depth_first_traverse``` - traversal of a graph using the depth-first algorithm
- ```breadth_first_traverse``` - traversal of a graph using the breadth-first algorithm

<br>By completeing these tasks I gained a solid understanding of what a graph is and the neccessary algorithms to do so.

## Learning objectives

- What is a graph
- What are vertices and edges
- What are the different types of graphs (directed, weighted, â€¦)
- What are the most common ways used to represent graphs in C
- How to traverse a graph using DFS and BFS

## Provided Code and Headers

```graphs.h``` will contain provided structs and some prototypes.  If there are any aditional data types or prototypes I will need they will be added there.

## Main files

Files within ```/main_files``` are provided examples of how my code will be utilized and the expected output when ran
