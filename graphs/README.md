# Graphs

With in this directory I will be learning about graphs.  A graph is a collection of nodes that have connections (edges) to one another.  For this project I will be <br>
- Allocating memory of a node
- Add a vertex or node to an existing graph
- Add an edge between two exiting vertices or nodes
- Deleting a graph
- Depht-first traversal
- Breadth-first traversal

## Learning objectives

- What is a graph
- What are vertices and edges
- What are the different types of graphs (directed, weighted, â€¦)
- What are the most common ways used to represent graphs in C
- How to traverse a graph using DFS and BFS

## Main files

Files within main_files are provided examples of how my code will be utilized and the expected output when ran
